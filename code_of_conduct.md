We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Learning Environment Standards

Because this is an educational resource, we have additional standards:

### For Contributors

- **Assume beginners** will read your content - explain clearly
- **Be encouraging** - learning can be intimidating
- **Provide constructive feedback** - suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- **Respect the learning curve** - what's obvious to you may not be to others
- **Stay on topic** - keep discussions relevant to NPM and package management

### For Learners

- **Ask questions freely** - no question is too basic
- **Be patient** with response times - contributors are volunteers
- **Search before asking** - check if your question has been answered
- **Provide context** - include error messages, code snippets, etc.
- **Share your solutions** - help others learn from your experience
